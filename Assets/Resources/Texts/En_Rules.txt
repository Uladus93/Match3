   There are two types of enemies in the game: (3)Harkonnens - every five matches capture and control the territory with which you can not interact, (4)Worms - occupy one cell of the territory of the playing field. To rid the territory of the enemy you should press the cell with the LKM, provided that you have a bonus that allows you to do this, (5)bomb for Harkonnens, (6)trap and (7)water for Worms. The (3)Harkonnen soldiers and the territories they capture are also disposed of by the neighboring cells involved in the match that took place.
